# Facial Expression Recognition System
A Deep Learning-based AI model that detects facial expressions and classifies emotions using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), OpenCV, and TensorFlow/Keras.

# Project Overview
This project uses computer vision and deep learning to recognize human emotions from facial expressions. The model is trained on a dataset containing seven emotion categories and can classify images into emotions such as Happy, Sad, Angry, Fear, Disgust, Neutral, and Surprise. This system can be applied in human-computer interaction, sentiment analysis, and AI-driven assistants.

# Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib
Model Architecture: CNN with BatchNormalization, Dropout, MaxPooling
Dataset: Facial expression dataset (7 emotion categories)
Optimization: Adam Optimizer, Precision & Recall metrics

# Features
Recognizes 7 different facial expressions.
Trained using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
Uses OpenCV for face detection and preprocessing.
It can be integrated into real-time AI systems.

# Future Improvements
Improve model accuracy with a larger dataset
Deploy as a Flask API for web-based emotion recognition
Add real-time video-based emotion detection
